#### Server Migration Patterns

In this session, you will perform web server migration in different migration patterns. Below section and diagram provides an overview for different migration patterns. 

1. **REHOST**: Move applications without changes. (aka lift-and-shift). Benefit from AWS migration tools like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudendure-migration/" target="_blank">CloudEndure</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/server-migration-service/" target="_blank">SMS</a>
2. **REPLATFORM**: Make a few cloud optimizations to achieve a tangible benefit. You will not change the core architecture of the application.
3. **REPURCHASE**: Move from perpetual licenses to a software-as-a-service model. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/mp/migration/" target="_blank">AWS Marketplace</a> offers a curated digital catalog of software solutions that support each phase of migration.
4. **REFACTOR**: Re-imagine how the application is architected and developed using cloud-native features.
